    /* This will house the sitemap.xml/robots.txt generator

    At this point in time building a list of all URLs from the
    types and pages present in the database are what is required
    to output the SEO content.  Many conveniences can be added
    with updates in the future.

	One goal is to create will have an update class that will
    automatically update the sitemap when posts or pages are
    created, deleted, or edited.

    This will need to be done through a library call to update.
    The problem with this lies in more memory usage when updating
    everything.  For this reason, the auto-update feature should
    be able to be enabled or disabled in the settings. */
